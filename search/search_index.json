What is Magnolia? Magnolia is a free, open source and mineable blockchain that aims to make the most of the miners' hashrate. To do so, each miner decides the amount he/she wants to mine per block. How does it work? Each miner can choose the amount he wants to receive in return for mining the block. The difficulty of the block is adapted to the amount of NOLIA the miner decides to mine. Each NOLIA reward adds 6000 to the difficulty, following a fairly obvious linear progression: Hashrate NOLIA mined* Difficulty 100 h/s 1NOLIA/block 6000 200 h/s 2NOLIA/block 12000 500 h/s 3NOLIA/block 30000 1000 h/s 10NOLIA/block 60000 *Recommended NOLIA mined adapted to hashrate The mining software will test during the first minute the hashrate, and will decide how many NOLIA to mine per block to take full advantage of the power. If for example the miner's hashrate amounts to 870 h/s: Hashrate NOLIA mined* Difficulty 870 h/s 8NOLIA/block 52200 *Recommended NOLIA mined adapted to hashrate Comparison with classic mining: This form of mining allows NOLIA to be created based on the mining power of the network, so the price should be much more stable than classic cryptocurrencies. In this example table we can see how the Magnolia network would evolve compared to Bitcoin in its early days: Hashrate Generated NOLIA Generated BTC 100 h/s 1 NOLIA every 60 seconds 50 BTC every 600 seconds 10000 h/s 100 NOLIA every 60 seconds 50 BTC every 600 seconds 20000 h/s 200 NOLIA every 60 seconds 50 BTC every 600 seconds 100000 h/s 1,000 NOLIA every 60 seconds 50 BTC every 600 seconds 1000000 h/s 10,000 NOLIA every 60 seconds 50 BTC every 600 seconds Is there a maximum number of NOLIAs? No. As in the Ethereum network, there is no maximum number of NOLIA that can be generated. What happens with commissions? All NOLIA used to pay commissions are burned instead of being collected by miners as in other blockchains. Are there halvings? As in classic mining we have included halvings, but instead of reducing the number of NOLIA generated, what we do is to increase the difficulty, while reducing the minimum reward per block. the minimum reward per block. For halvings, instead of selecting a block number, a specific timestamp will be selected: Hashrate Diff per NOLIA Min. coins per Block 2022 15000 10 NOLIA 2023 30000 5 NOLIA 2024 60000 2 NOLIA 2025 120000 1 NOLIA Are there mining pools? Since each miner can select the number of NOLIA he wants to generate, thus adapting the mining difficulty to his power, the idea of mining pools does not make much sense in principle. makes little sense. Perhaps in the future, when the difficulty has increased sufficiently, a software for pool mining will be interesting, which we will implement if necessary.","title":"Magnolia Whitepaper"},{"location":"#magnolia-whitepaper","text":"This is an earlier, shorter version of Magnolia's whitepaper.","title":"Magnolia Whitepaper"},{"location":"#what-is-magnolia","text":"Magnolia is a free, open source and mineable blockchain that aims to make the most of the miners' hashrate.
