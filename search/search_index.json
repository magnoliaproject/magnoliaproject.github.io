What is Magnolia? Magnolia is a blockchain written from scratch using PHP, Python3 and MongoDB, designed so that all miners have an equal chance to mine a block regardless of his hashrate. This favors decentralization and eliminates the possibility of 51% attacks. It is also compatible with the main features of Ethereum, as well as the Metamask wallet. New features will be added in the future, to highlight: Simple contracts without programming: The code for these contracts will be integrated into the server source code. Contract Editor / Manager: Written in HTML5 and javascript, accessible from any browser with the Metamask extension. Advanced contracts: Written in PHP, similar to EVM-compatible blockchain Solidity contracts. Support for tokens, NFT and decentralized applications. Staking: Stake your NOLIA for get governance tokens. Who is behind this project? Magnolia has a DAO structure, so it is the community that makes the decisions and chooses the priorities in the Roadmap. For this purpose, the NOLIA token can be staked to obtain governance tokens, which can be used to vote on the different proposals. The project is developed by five people linked to the crypto community who make up the core development team, to which new developers are always welcome. For the moment, the five of us prefer to keep our anonymity so that this does not interfere with our jobs and/or main projects. NOLIA was premined? NOPE! The development team only mined the genesis block on March 1, 2022 and 3 more blocks for test the network, for the value of 40 NOLIA. After that, no more block will be mined by team in first 24 hours. After that, we put to work a team with modest hardware (100 h/s) so that in case there are no more miners, blocks will continue to be generated. You can check this by visiting our address in the block explorer: https://magnolia.eslime.net/explorer/address.html?address=0x0fa10b766aD2F40110BE9ed1fEFdbcD2bDdB432F What about exchanges? From the last weekend of March 2022, 50% of the NOLIA mined by the development team will be added to SushiSwap NOLIA-ONE pool. If a user wishes to sell their NOLIA, they must first submit them to the Harmony blockchain (ONE) via our Bridge. Likewise, NOLIA acquired on the exchange can be sent to our blockchain using the same method: Link to the bridge will be available soon. Link to DEX will be available soon. You can contribute to the project by adding your NOLIA to the DEX pool to increase liquidity: Add liquidity link will be available soon. Initially, 1 ONE for every 100 NOLIA will be added to the NOLIA-ONE pair.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-magnolia-dao","text":"Welcome to Magnolia DAO documentation.","title":"Welcome to Magnolia DAO"},{"location":"#what-is-magnolia","text":"Magnolia is a blockchain written from scratch using PHP, Python3 and MongoDB, designed so that all miners have an equal chance to mine a block regardless of his hashrate.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we\u2019ll use the Chrome version, but the instructions will be more or less the same for every platform. Firstly, you\u2019ll want to head over to the MetaMask Download page. From there, select whichever platform you\u2019re using, and follow the steps to install it on your device. Easy! Next, follow along with the setup specified by the app. Go ahead and click Create a Wallet. Write down the backup seed phrase somewhere secret (preferably not on an Internet-connected device). Without this phrase, your funds can\u2019t be recovered if your device is damaged or lost. Confirm that you\u2019ve written them down on the next page. And that\u2019s it! You should now see your wallet, ready to send and receive funds. Configuring the wallet You might notice straight away that we\u2019re still dealing with an Ethereum wallet. At best, this won\u2019t work with Magnolia DApps. At worst, you could lose funds by sending them to addresses you can\u2019t actually use. Let\u2019s change that.

It\u2019s important to note that there are two networks we can use here: the testnet or the mainnet. Below are the parameters to fill in for each.

We recommend adding both if you intend to use MetaMask to transfer NOLIA or Magnolia tokens. Once you Save the Network and return to the main view, you\u2019ll notice two things: the network has automatically been set to the one you just entered, and the units are no longer denominated in ETH, but in NOLIA.

What is Magnolia? Magnolia is a free, open source and mineable blockchain that aims to make the most of the miners' hashrate. To do so, each miner decides the amount he/she wants to mine per block. How does it work? Each miner can choose the amount he wants to receive in return for mining the block. The difficulty of the block is adapted to the amount of NOLIA the miner decides to mine. Each NOLIA reward adds 60000 to the difficulty, following a fairly obvious linear progression: Hashrate NOLIA mined* Difficulty 100 h/s 1 NOLIA/block 60000 200 h/s 2 NOLIA/block 120000 500 h/s 3 NOLIA/block 300000 1000 h/s 10 NOLIA/block 600000 *Recommended NOLIA mined adapted to hashrate The mining software will test during the first minute the hashrate, and will decide how many NOLIA to mine per block to take full advantage of the power. If for example the miner's hashrate amounts to 870 h/s: Hashrate NOLIA mined* Difficulty 870 h/s 9 NOLIA/block 54000 *Recommended NOLIA mined adapted to hashrate Comparison with classic mining This way of mining allows NOLIA to be created based on the mining power of the network, so the price should be much more stable than classic cryptocurrencies. In this example table we can see how the Magnolia network would evolve compared to Bitcoin in its early days: Hashrate Generated NOLIA Generated BTC 100 h/s 1 NOLIA / 600 seconds 50 BTC / 600 seconds 10,000 h/s 100 NOLIA / 600 seconds 50 BTC / 600 seconds 20,000 h/s 200 NOLIA / 600 seconds 50 BTC / 600 seconds 100,000 h/s 1,000 NOLIA / 600 seconds 50 BTC / 600 seconds 1,000,000 h/s 10,000 NOLIA / 600 seconds 50 BTC / 600 seconds Miners (1Kh/s per miner) NOLIA Blocks BTC Blocks 1 miner 1 block / 600 seconds 1 block / 600 seconds 10 miners 1 block / 60 seconds 1 block / 600 seconds 20 miners 1 block / 30 seconds 1 block / 600 seconds 100 miners 1 block / 6 seconds 1 block / 600 seconds 600 miners 1 block / 1 second 1 block / 600 seconds Is there a maximum number of NOLIA? No. As in the Ethereum network, there is no maximum number of NOLIA that can be generated. What happens with fees? All NOLIA used to pay fees are burned instead of being collected by miners as in other blockchains. Are there halvings? As in classic mining we have included halvings, but instead of reducing the number of NOLIA generated, what we do is to increase the difficulty, while reducing the minimum reward per block. the minimum reward per block. For halvings, instead of selecting a block number, a specific timestamp will be selected: Hashrate Diff per NOLIA Min. coins per Block 2022 60000 10 NOLIA 2023 120000 5 NOLIA 2024 240000 3 NOLIA 2025 480000 2 NOLIA 2026 960000 1 NOLIA Are there mining pools? Since each miner can select the number of NOLIA he wants to generate, thus adapting the mining difficulty to his power, the idea of mining pools does not make much sense in principle. Perhaps in the future, when the difficulty has increased sufficiently, a software for pool mining will be interesting, which we will implement if necessary.","title":"Whitepaper"},{"location":"whitepaper/#magnolia-whitepaper","text":"This is an earlier, shorter version of Magnolia's whitepaper.","title":"Magnolia Whitepaper"},{"location":"whitepaper/#what-is-magnolia","text":"Magnolia is a free, open source and mineable blockchain that aims to make the most of the miners' hashrate.
