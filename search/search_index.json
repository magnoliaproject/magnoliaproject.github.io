What is Magnolia? Magnolia is a free, open source and mineable blockchain that aims to make the most of the miners' hashrate. To do so, each miner decides the amount he/she wants to mine per block. How does it work? Each miner can choose the amount he wants to receive in return for mining the block. The difficulty of the block is adapted to the amount of NOLIA the miner decides to mine. Each NOLIA reward adds 6000 to the difficulty, following a fairly obvious linear progression: Hashrate NOLIA mined* Difficulty 100 h/s 1 NOLIA/block 6000 200 h/s 2 NOLIA/block 12000 500 h/s 3 NOLIA/block 30000 1000 h/s 10 NOLIA/block 60000 *Recommended NOLIA mined adapted to hashrate The mining software will test during the first minute the hashrate, and will decide how many NOLIA to mine per block to take full advantage of the power. If for example the miner's hashrate amounts to 870 h/s: Hashrate NOLIA mined* Difficulty 870 h/s 9 NOLIA/block 54000 *Recommended NOLIA mined adapted to hashrate Comparison with classic mining: This form of mining allows NOLIA to be created based on the mining power of the network, so the price should be much more stable than classic cryptocurrencies. In this example table we can see how the Magnolia network would evolve compared to Bitcoin in its early days: Hashrate Generated NOLIA Generated BTC 100 h/s 1 NOLIA every 60 seconds 50 BTC every 600 seconds 10,000 h/s 100 NOLIA every 60 seconds 50 BTC every 600 seconds 20,000 h/s 200 NOLIA every 60 seconds 50 BTC every 600 seconds 100,000 h/s 1,000 NOLIA every 60 seconds 50 BTC every 600 seconds 1,000,000 h/s 10,000 NOLIA every 60 seconds 50 BTC every 600 seconds Is there a maximum number of NOLIAs? No. As in the Ethereum network, there is no maximum number of NOLIA that can be generated. What happens with commissions? All NOLIA used to pay commissions are burned instead of being collected by miners as in other blockchains. Are there halvings? As in classic mining we have included halvings, but instead of reducing the number of NOLIA generated, what we do is to increase the difficulty, while reducing the minimum reward per block. the minimum reward per block. For halvings, instead of selecting a block number, a specific timestamp will be selected: Hashrate Diff per NOLIA Min. coins per Block 2022 15000 10 NOLIA 2023 30000 5 NOLIA 2024 60000 3 NOLIA 2025 120000 2 NOLIA 2026 240000 1 NOLIA Are there mining pools? Since each miner can select the number of NOLIA he wants to generate, thus adapting the mining difficulty to his power, the idea of mining pools does not make much sense in principle. Perhaps in the future, when the difficulty has increased sufficiently, a software for pool mining will be interesting, which we will implement if necessary.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#magnolia-whitepaper","text":"This is an earlier, shorter version of Magnolia's whitepaper.","title":"Magnolia Whitepaper"},{"location":"#what-is-magnolia","text":"Magnolia is a free, open source and mineable blockchain that aims to make the most of the miners' hashrate.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we\u2019ll use the Firefox version, but the instructions will be more or less the same for every platform. Firstly, you\u2019ll want to head over to the MetaMask Download page. From there, select whichever platform you\u2019re using, and follow the steps to install it on your device. Easy! Next, follow along with the setup specified by the app. Go ahead and click Create a Wallet. Write down the backup seed phrase somewhere secret (preferably not on an Internet-connected device). Without this phrase, your funds can\u2019t be recovered if your device is damaged or lost. Confirm that you\u2019ve written them down on the next page. And that\u2019s it! You should now see your wallet, ready to send and receive funds. Configuring the wallet You might notice straight away that we\u2019re still dealing with an Ethereum wallet. At best, this won\u2019t work with Magnolia DApps. At worst, you could lose funds by sending them to addresses you can\u2019t actually use. Let\u2019s change that.

It\u2019s important to note that there are two networks we can use here: the testnet or the mainnet. Below are the parameters to fill in for each. Mainnet (This is the one you are probably looking for) Network Name: Magnolia New RPC URL: https://magnolia.eslime.net/ ChainID: 72 Symbol: NOLIA Block Explorer URL: https://magnoliascan.eslime.net/ Testnet Network Name: Magnolia - Testnet New RPC URL: https://noliatestnet.eslime.net/ ChainID: 720 Symbol: NOLIA Block Explorer URL: https://magnoliatestscan.eslime.net/ We\u2019re going to use the testnet in this tutorial, but you will likely want to use the mainnet. We recommend adding both if you intend to use MetaMask to transfer NOLIA or Magnolia tokens. Once you Save the Network and return to the main view, you\u2019ll notice two things: the network has automatically been set to the one you just entered, and the units are no longer denominated in ETH, but in NOLIA. imagen Closing thoughts MetaMask has long been the go-to passport for accessing the sprawling Ethereum landscape. But, with minimal effort, anyone can configure it to point towards Magnolia Blockchain.
